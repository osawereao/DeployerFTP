# DeployerFTP
DeployerFTP streamlines the deployment process for web applications and APIs through a GitHub workflow/action setup. This tool simplifies the deployment to an online server using FTP, making it a seamless and efficient solution for your deployment needs.


## NOTE:
This workflow action will fail because the secret credentials are not defined, as I do not need the branch to publish/deploy any code to my server.
But everything is working fine and it can seen on the error message returned as reason for this failure.
